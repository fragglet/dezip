   About the Windows CE Port (known as "Pocket UnZip")
_______________________________________________________________________________

The Windows CE port, known as Pocket UnZip, is designed to run on Microsoft's
Windows CE operating system.  The port is completely contained in the files
listed above.  There were very few minor modifications made to the Info-ZIP
code in order for this port to work.  This was possible because the Info-ZIP
code is fairly generic and also because several hooks have already been placed
in the code from past Windows ports.  The Windows CE port leverages off of
these efforts for two reasons.  Mainly, I wanted to avoid modifying the
Info-ZIP core code since people don't like it when your changes break other
ports.  Second, this makes the Windows CE port easy to upgrade when fixes and
features are released by the Info-ZIP group.

The port is made up of the project file (punzip.dsp), one global header
(punzip.h), three main source modules (winmain.cpp/h, intrface.cpp/h, and
wince.cpp/h), the resource script files (punzip.rc, punzip.rcv, and resource.h),
several resources (punzip.ic2, zipfile.ic2, imglist.2bp, ilmask.bmp,
toolbar.2bp, punzip.ico, zipfile.ico, imglist.bmp, and toolbar.bmp), and the
help file (punzip.htp).

The application's entry point is WinMain(), which is located in winmain.cpp
(what a surprise).  winmain.cpp basically contains all the Windows code and the
user interface.  It knows nothing about the Info-ZIP code or things like the
Globals struct.  That stuff is the job of the intrface module.  intrface.cpp
implements an easy (or at least easier) to understand interface to the Info-ZIP
routines.  It also handles all the callbacks from Info-ZIP and relays the
appropriate information back to the code in winmain.cpp.  The final module is
wince.cpp.  This module implements all the Win32 APIs and C runtime functions
that are called by the rest of the code, but are not natively implemented on
Windows CE.  Most all of this module is excluded for NT native builds.

Two preprocessor defines are used in conjunction with several defines from
the Info-ZIP code and from other ports.  The two that are specific to the
Windows CE port are:

     POCKET_UNZIP   Always set for the Windows CE port (CE and NT).
     _WIN32_WCE     Set for Windows CE native; not set for Windows NT native.

These three defines are the minimum defines that must be addressed by the
project file in order to build this port.  This port's main header, punzip.h,
gets included by all the Info-ZIP source files when POCKET_UNZIP is defined.
punzip.h in turn ensures that all the other relevant Info-ZIP defines are set
to correctly build the port.  If you wish to alter the Info-ZIP defines used to
build this port, you can do so by altering punzip.h.

There are quite a few _WIN32_WCE checks throughout the source files for this
port.  These checks allow the application to build natively for Windows NT for
debugging purposes, and just because it can with little effort due to the
similarities between the Windows CE API and the Windows NT API. Any non-Windows
CE code is assumed to be for Windows NT only.  This project currently will not
work on Windows 95 because Windows CE is mostly UNICODE, and this port assumes
that all Win32 calls to the operating system take UNICODE parameters.  I could
scatter a few dozen "#ifdef UNICODE" checks around and make it work on Windows
95, but I see no reason to complicate this port's code for that reason since
there is already a Windows 95 port of the Info-ZIP code.

   Building the Windows CE Port (known as "Pocket UnZip")
_______________________________________________________________________________

At the time this README was written, Microsoft just released Visual C++ for
Windows CE version 1.0.  This development kit uses the the standard Microsoft
Visual C++ version 5.0 development environment and project files (DSP files).
To build Windows CE binaries of Pocket UnZip, you will need version 1.0 or
later of Visual C++ for Windows CE.

This port's project file, punzip.dsp, contains the information for building all
the various binaries.  These include Windows NT native, Windows CE native for
Hitachi SH-3 processors, and Windows CE native for MIPS processors.  All
projects have Debug and Retail flavors as well.  The following list the
Windows CE devices and which binary they run:

     Manufacturer             CPU             Binary
     ---------------------    ------------    ------
     Philips Electronics      MIPS R3910      MIPS
     NEC Corp.                NEC VR4101      MIPS
     Casio Computer Co.       Hitachi SH-3    SH-3
     Compaq Computer Corp.    Hitachi SH-3    SH-3
     Hewlett-Packard Co.      Hitachi SH-3    SH-3
     Hitachi Ltd.             Hitachi SH-3    SH-3
     LG Electronics Inc.      Hitachi SH-3    SH-3

Before building Pocket UnZip, you will need to move some files around.  If you
have just unzipped the Info-ZIP's UnZip 5.30 sources, you should have a root
directory with the core Info-ZIP files in it and several subdirectories under it
for the various ports, one of which is the WinCE directory.  Move punzip.dsp
from the WinCE subdirectory to the Info-ZIP root and open it with Visual C++ for
Windows CE version 1.0 or later.  The project file uses all the files in the
WinCE subdirectory as well as the following files in the Info-ZIP root:

     api.c        crypt.h      globals.c    process.c    unzip.h
     consts.h     ebcdic.h     globals.h    ttyio.c      unzpriv.h
     crc32.c      explode.c    inflate.c    ttyio.h      version.h
     crctab.c     extract.c    inflate.h    unreduce.c   zip.h
     crypt.c      fileio.c     list.c       unshrink.c
